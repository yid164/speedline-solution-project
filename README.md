# speedline-solution-project

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Step 1

#### Develop a plan to create a proof of concept for this project.
    1. Does our proposed "mushup" seem feasible?
    2. Briefly describe the key pieces of functionality that we'd need in the final product
        Example: "I need to be able to display arbitrary data on an embedded Google Map"
    3. Briefly describe the tools, technologies and platforms that you plan on using for your proof of concept.
    4. Would the tools, technologies and platforms that you would use for your proof of concept be appropriate to use in production? What limitations might they have?
    5. Briefly describe how you would evaluate each "key piece of functionality" above.
    6. Estimate how far you think you could get in your proof of concept in the allotted time.

### Step 2

    Implement a proof of concept. 
    Follow your plan or change it as necessary. 
    If you take shortcuts in your proof of concept, please include highlights of those shortcuts (by adding comments in the code when possible) and explain any changes that would need to be made to make the code production quality.

### Step 3

#### Provide feedback on following:
    1. What architecture and design changes would you make for the project to move from prototype to production? 
    2. How would you make the code more maintainable if the project were to move from prototype to production?
